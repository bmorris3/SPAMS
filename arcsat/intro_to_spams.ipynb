    "\n",
    "Welcome to SPAMS! I'm sorry for not being here in this first week, hopefully these tutorials will keep you busy in the mean time. I return on Wednesday November 11, and I expect everything in this notebook to be completed by then. Some of the notebook covers tutorials for the software, which you should do with the other SPAMS team members. Please sit together and help one another -- we're not competing, we're a team! \n",
    "\n",
    "The section below has a bunch of readings for you to complete. Each reading comes with a brief writing request which I expect you to share with me (more specific instructions below). Be sure to complete both the readings and tutorials before I return!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading\n",
    "\n",
    "Below this section we're going to do a tutorial of some of the code that you'll be using, but before we get to that, I'm going to describe reading assignments for you to do during each class session or at home if you can't finish in class. Don't forget to do these and to share your Google Doc of questions with me (my email address is bmmorris@uw.edu).\n",

    "There have been developements in the field since you've joined the project. Last week, a team looking for planets with the revived Kepler space telescope found a disintegrating planet orbiting a white dwarf just like the ones that we're hunting for. We've been beaten to the punch, but that should only encourage us to push harder on the data that we already have, because now we have proof that these planets are out there! [Follow this link](http://astrobites.org/2015/10/26/dead-star-dying-planets/) and please read the astrobites summary of the article announcing the discovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, I want you to actually read [the original paper published in the scientific journal *Nature*](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v526/n7574/full/nature15527.html). This will be hard, but I know you can get through it. A lot of the words in this article are words you do not know yet, and I'm giving you this challenge to take stock of what I can teach you. Open up a Google Doc and take note of the words you don't know or questions you have about the paper - I expect you to have lots. When I return, we can go over what you don't know so you'll be a few steps closer to being an expert in this newly developing field.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this feels like a difficult task, that's because it is! But this is good practice for research in any field -- knowing what you don't know and then learning how to find that stuff out is an important skill to build. **Please share your Google Doc with me once you've made it.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wednesday (due Friday)\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the motivations for the work that we're doing is to learn about the interiors of planets, since the metal-polluted white dwarfs are polluted by metals that were once planets. If we measure the abundances of those metals relative to one another, we can learn about the bulk composition of the planet that fell onto the star. This is cool because we can't see the insides of planets in virtually any other way. Please read [this astrobites article on what we can learn from these dead planets](http://astrobites.org/2014/11/17/exploring-the-planetary-graveyard/), which is the primary reason why I think this project is important.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Also please read [this very short, three page paper](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.03142v1.pdf) that was posted in May summarizing how studies of metal-polluted white dwarfs can be used to probe the bulk properties of planets in the next 20 years. \n",
    "\n",
    "Every 10 years in astronomy, a panel of astronomers is assembled that lays out the priorities for the field over the coming decade, called the Decadal Survey. They then release a book on the consensus they reach on which topics should be our top priorities on long term, impactful projects that require a lot of funding. This is one of the ways astronomers try to manage our requests from Congress, by saying that we as a field have prioritized certain goals. The astronomers who wrote this paper think studying metal-polluted white dwarfs should be part of the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you read these two papers, add to the Google Doc from Monday and add new words you'd like defined or techniques you'd like explained. Give me lots to explain - I want to answer all of your questions!\n",

    "\n",
    "The tutorial below shows how to use some of the code that we'll be working with. I'm developing this code as the project grows, so some of the tools might not work perfectly but I'll fix things as we break them.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a combination of tutorials and readings for you to go through in this notebook which I expect to be completed when I return on Wednesday, Nov 11. I've asked for you to do some writing on the reading assignments, so \n",

    "### Opening images: DS9\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to find anything strange in a light curve, before we jump to the conclusion that we've discovered a planet, we would need to open up the raw images and see if they look OK. Sometimes the quirks in the detector can give us data that look exciting, but only turn out to be artifacts. So let's practice opening the raw images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The images that we take are stored in a format called `FITS` (rather than JPG or PNG, for example). This format basically stores an array - the image - and a bunch of metadata, like the time that the image was taken, where in the sky you were looking, etc. To open FITS images, we need to use a program called DS9. You can open DS9 from your UNIX terminal by typing `ds9`. Open up DS9 and follow along with [this tutorial](http://astrobites.org/2011/03/09/how-to-use-sao-ds9-to-examine-astronomical-images/) to get to know how to handle our images.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you're done with the tutorial from astrobites, try opening an image that Doug Branton and I took in August, which is stored at this path: \n",
    "```\n",
    "/astro/users/bmmorris/SPAMS/WD1935+276_B_20150807_032315corrected.fits\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this image, we were studying the white dwarf called WD 1935+276. Put that name into the astronomical database [SIMBAD](http://simbad.cfa.harvard.edu/simbad/sim-fid) and take a look at the entry for our star. There are coordinates for our target on the line of the data table that starts with `ICRS`. Look for those coordinates in the data image, and see if you can figure out which star in the image is the white dwarf we should be studying. \n",
    "\n",
    "Stare at this star pensively for a moment and imagine the doomed worlds that may be spiraling into their fiery, 10,000+ K oblivion. Imagine the civilizations that may have once roamed those worlds of molten rock and dust. Imagine that we're hunting for their final pulse, written in a light curve that only we can hear. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now wipe your tears away and move on to the software tutorial.\n",

    "### `padre`\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the Introduction, the software package `padre` has lots of tools for allowing us to get useful science out of our images of the sky. Let's experiment with its features to: open some light curves, explore their contents, and begin to hunt for planets by eye.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's download the package, and some notebooks and other resources that we'll use. If you're visiting this notebook for the first time on GitHub, you should clone this git repository and then open the notebook from your terminal, so you can experiment with each cell's contents. Here's how you do that:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1)** `cd` to change directories into your `Astro192/` directory. When in `Astro192/`, type: \n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/bmorris3/SPAMS.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "to get a copy of the `SPAMS` repository. You should see a bunch of text like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[bmmorris@astrolab1 Astro192]$ git clone https://github.com/bmorris3/SPAMS.git\n",
    "Cloning into 'SPAMS'...\n",
    "remote: Counting objects: 306, done.\n",
    "remote: Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.\n",
    "remote: Total 306 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 303\n",
    "Receiving objects: 100% (306/306), 2.84 MiB | 1.46 MiB/s, done.\n",
    "Resolving deltas: 100% (137/137), done.\n",
    "Checking connectivity... done.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once that's done, you now have a `SPAMS` directory. `cd` into it. \n",
    "\n",
    "**2)** `ls` and look around. There are a lot of files in there. Most of them were made while working with last year's Pre-MAP students to pick the targets that we'd observe. \n",
    "\n",
    "**3)** `cd` into the `SPAMS/arcsat` directory. In there, there's a directory called `padre` which is the Photometric ARCSAT Data REduction package that I wrote for us to use. That's the software that takes all of the images from the telescope and turns them into *light curves* (measurements of brightness over time). `cd` into `padre` and `cat` a few of the `*.py` files to check out all of the code in there. Don't panic - I don't expect you to know how any of this works, but I want you to take note that there's just a bunch of commands in there that will look somewhat familiar. Mostly it's working with the images as `numpy` arrays and manipulating them to take measurements. The skills that you're learning in class can be applied to any arbitrarily complicated problem.\n"
